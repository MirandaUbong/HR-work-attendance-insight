# HR-work-attendance-insight
The objectives of this project was to visualize employee data using Power BI to:

1.	Understand the working preference of people; between Work-from-Home and Work-from-Office.

2.	Why certain people prefer to either WFH or WFO on certain days of the work week.

3.	Get (percentage) attendance data of people over time.

4.	Improve capacity planning for a hybrid mode of work system.

5.	Ascertain percentage leave type rates: e.g., number of people sick leave across different times/seasons to take precautions if covid, reason for the sick leave, find pattern with seasonal flus to enable better sensitization and preventive measures.
